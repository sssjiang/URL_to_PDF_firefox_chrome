存在两个python环境吗？

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Explaining Python environments**

The user is asking if there are two Python environments. On macOS, the system Python located at `/usr/bin/python3` is linked to Apple's version, while the Homebrew Python is in `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`. So yes, there are two installations: the system version and the Homebrew version. I'll suggest the user run commands like `python -V && which -a python python3`, and `python3 -V` to check versions, and `python -m pip --version` for pip paths, to see more about their setup.
**Warning About Mixing Pip**

I should mention that the user needs to be careful about mixing pip across different Python installations. I can suggest aligning the alias to point `python` to Homebrew's Python with `alias python=/opt/homebrew/bin/python3` or updating the PATH. However, I won't run commands unless the user asks for it. 

A concise answer should guide them to choose one Python version and update their shell's configuration file. It'd also be good to recommend creating a virtual environment for their projects. Since we're not using tools, I can keep it simple and clean.
**Confirming Dual Python Environments**

Yes, your shell currently has two Python executables. The mapping is as follows: `python` is aliased to `/usr/bin/python3` (system-installed), while `python3` points to `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3` (Homebrew). They are different installations with their own site-packages.

To check versions and pip locations, you can use these commands:

```
python -V; python -c "import sys,site; print(sys.executable); print(site.getsitepackages())"
python3 -V; python3 -c "import sys,site; print(sys.executable); print(site.getsitepackages())"
python -m pip --version
python3 -m pip --version
```

To unify, consider using Homebrew Python for both `python` and `pip`. You can add these aliases to your `/.zshrc` file:

```
alias python=/opt/homebrew/bin/python3
alias pip="/opt/homebrew/bin/pip3"
```

Alternatively, just use `python -m pip` and avoid aliases, or adjust your PATH. I also suggest creating a virtual environment with:

```
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
```

Finally, you can check both executables with `which -a python python3`. Keeping it concise!</details></think>

**是的，有两个 Python 安装。**
- `python` 被 alias 到系统自带的 `(/usr/bin/python3)`。
- `python3` 指向 Homebrew 安装的 `(/opt/homebrew/bin/python3)`。
它们有各自独立的 site-packages，可能导致包不一致。

### 如何确认
```bash
which -a python python3
python -V; python3 -V
python -m pip --version; python3 -m pip --version
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
python3 -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
```

### 建议用法
- 安装包时用 `python -m pip` 或 `python3 -m pip`，避免混用 `pip`。
- 统一到 Homebrew 版本可在 `~/.zshrc` 里设置：
```bash
alias python=/opt/homebrew/bin/python3
alias pip="/opt/homebrew/bin/pip3"
```
- 更推荐创建虚拟环境隔离项目：
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -U pip
```
